# 35 Quickest Alpe d'Huez Climbs - Athletes With and Without Doping Allegations

This is my answer to freeCodeCamp's Visualize Data with a Scatterplot Graph project. It shows data from 1994 to 2015 of the 35 fastest climbs of Alpe d'Huez. With hovering over the dots, a tooltip with details appear. One can also tap the dots on a touch device, although it's more clunky.

## Getting Started

No installation is required. You can simply run the code by opening the index.html file in a web browser. [Or go to where I host it](https://robiniversen.com/visualize-data-with-a-scatterplot-graph).

## Data Source

The data is sourced from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/cyclist-data.json.
